# Simply Typed Lambda Calculus in Haskell and Coq

<div align="justify">
This project involves the implementation of an interpreter for a simply typed lambda calculus in <strong>Haskell</strong>. The interpreter supports various features, including basic types, pairs, lists, and numerical operations, providing a foundational tool for understanding typed functional programming and type systems.

The project also includes an implementation of a simply typed lambda calculus interpreter in <strong>Coq</strong>. This part focuses on defining types, terms, and contexts, as well as implementing type checking and evaluation. Additionally, the Coq development includes formal proofs of key language properties, such as type preservation and determinism of evaluation.
